def vis_sample(imagefile=None, uvfile=None, uu=None, vv=None, mu_RA=0, mu_DEC=0, src_distance=None, gcf_holder=None, corr_cache=None, mode="interpolate", outfile=None, verbose=False, return_gcf=False, return_corr_cache=False):
    """Sample visibilities from a sky-brightness image

    vis_sample allows you to sample visibilities from a user-supplied sky-brightness image. 

    (u,v) grid points can either be supplied by the user, or can be retrieved from a template uvfits file / measurement set.

    The results can be output either to a uvfits file or returned back to the user (for scripting)


    Parameters
    __________
    imagefile : the input sky brightness image, needs to be in a valid FITS format with units of DEG for the RA and DEC, a RADMC3D image.out file (ascii format), or a SkyImage object (use with caution)

    for uv points use:
        uvfile - uvfits file or measurement set with visibilities that the sky brightness will be interpolated to
      OR        
        uu, vv - numpy arrays - they need to be in units of lambda (i.e. number of wavelengths)

    mu_RA - (optional, default = 0) right ascension offset from phase center in arcseconds (i.e. visibilities are sampled as if the image is centered at (mu_RA, mu_DEC)

    mu_DEC - (optional, default = 0) declination offset from phase center in arcseconds (i.e. visibilities are sampled as if the image is centered at (mu_RA, mu_DEC)

    src_distance - distance to source in parsecs - only required for RADMC3D input images
 
    gcf_holder - (optional) gcf_holder object returned by previous call to vis_sample (see below return_gcf). 
        If you use this option DO NOT feed in a uvfile or uu, vv arrays, this option is intended for batch processing

    corr_cache - (optional) 2D corr_cache array output by previous call to vis_sample (see below return_corr_cache).

    mode - (optional, default = interpolate) switch between returning the interpolated output ("interpolate") or the residuals when subtracted from the data ("diff")
        NOTE - all other options are retained, so if using outfile and diff, a residual measurement set will be output
        diff mode requires an input dataset, so it will NOT work with only a gcf_holder input, and the number of channels must match
        diff mode is NOT recommended for chi sq calculation in an MCMC code, as the data will be read in for each likelihood function call (slow)
        A better solution is to use the import functions in file_handling.py to read in the data once, then use the ouput of interpolate mode to calculate chi sq

    outfile - (optional) name of output file, needs to have either a .uvfits or .ms extension consistent with extension of uvfile

    verbose - (boolean) flag to print all progress output and timing

    return_gcf - (boolean) flag to return the gcf cache to allow faster interpolation for many models   
    
    return_corr_cache - (boolean) flag to return the correction function cache to allow faster interpolation for many models 


    Usage::

    First, import the vis_sample command 
    >> from vis_sampler import vis_sample 


    1. sample my_model.fits using data.ms (u,v) points and output to interp.ms
    >> vis_sample(imagefile="my_model.fits", uvfile="data.ms", outfile='interp.ms') 


    2. sample my_model.fits using data.ms (u,v) points, interp_vis stores visibilities
    >> interp_vis = vis_sample(imagefile="my_model.fits", uvfile="data.ms") 


    In the second usage, interp_vis is the "raw" output visibility, ie just a numpy array of size [n_visibilities, n_chans]
    We can also output the caches for faster future usage:


    3. a) sample my_model.fits using data.ms (u,v) points, also store the gcf_holder
    >> interp, gcf_holder = vis_sample(imagefile="my_model.fits", uvfile="data.ms", return_gcf = True)

    3. b) sample a second model using the same (u,v) points, this is faster now
    >> interp2 = vis_sample(imagefile="second_model.fits", gcf_holder = gcf_holder)                                 


    4. a) sample my_model.fits using data.ms (u,v) points, also store the gcf_holder and corr_cache
    >> interp, gcf_holder, corr_cache = vis_sample(imagefile="my_model.fits", uvfile="data.uvfits", return_gcf = True, return_corr_cache = True)

    4. b) sample a second model using the same (u,v) points, this is faster now
    >> interp2 = vis_sample(imagefile="second_model.fits", gcf_holder = gcf_holder, corr_cache=corr_cache)
